         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>IT is now ſeven Years and more, ſince I firſt read over this little Piece of <hi>Bertram</hi> in Latin, and the Satisfaction I had to ſee ſo Learned a Writer expreſly confute the Error of Tranſubſtantiation, at its firſt riſe in the Weſtern Church, invited me to a ſecond and third Reading, and the Book not being very common, I entertained thoughts of Reprinting it, both in <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Engliſh;</hi> for remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring where I had ſeen an Engliſh <hi>Bertram,</hi> Publiſhed by Sir <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrey Lynd,</hi> A. D. <hi>1623.</hi> I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed my ſelf, that Publiſhing it in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> would add but little to my trouble, not ſuſpecting that a
<pb facs="tcp:66341:5"/>
Tranſlation publiſhed by that Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Gentleman, could have been other than accurate. I therefore got together as many various Editions of the Book as I could, and ſent for the Engliſh Verſion, upon ſight of which I ſaw my ſelf diſappointed. For there are ſome Miſtakes in ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring the <hi>Latin words,</hi> two of which may be ſeen in the Preface. For Inſtance, <hi>Catholice Sapere,</hi> is Tranſlated <hi>to be univerſally Wiſe,</hi> which ſhould have been rendred <hi>to be Orthodox,</hi> or <hi>Catholick in his Judgment;</hi> and again, <hi>Non aequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimiter iſta perpendens</hi> is rendred (though perhaps not quietly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently conſidering of theſe things) inſtead of ſadly laying to heart theſe things, [<hi>viz.</hi> the Schiſm on occaſion of the new Doctrin of Tranſubſtantiation.] And ſeveral other ſlips of that kind, I obſerved, which made me gueſs the Tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on could not be the work of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Knight, who recommended it to the Publick. But had this been
<pb facs="tcp:66341:5"/>
all, a little time and pains might have rectified thoſe Miſtakes. That which rendred the Tranſlation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerviceable to me, was the perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the ſtyle, through unneceſſary Parentheſes, and the multiplying of Synonimous words, and in ſome places by rendring the Author too much word for word, ſo that it doth not give the Reader a clear appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of the Author's ſenſe. And to juſtifie this charge, I need only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Reader to the ninth and tenth Pages of the new Impreſſion of <hi>Bertram,</hi> where he proves that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration makes no Phyſical change in the Bread and Wine; but as he is there Tranſlated, his reaſoning is hardly intelligible.</p>
                  <p>Yet, I accuſe not the Tranſlator of unfaithfulneſs, but freely acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that had his skill been equal to his Fidelity, I would have uſed his Verſion, and ſaved my ſelf the trouble of a new one, which I made and tranſcribed in <hi>Septem. 1681.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:66341:6"/>Having finiſhed my Tranſlation, I proceeded to collect materials for the Diſſertation I intended, which I caſt into looſe Papers, and deſiring a Learned Friend to aſſiſt me, with what he knew on that Subject, he put into my hands an Edition I had not before met with, in <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Latine,</hi> with a Learned Advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment prefixed, in which I found the Work deſigned by me, was already very well performed, ſo that my La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour might be ſpared. Thus I laid aſide my Papers, and all thoughts of making them publick, till about two Months ſince, and then reſumed them, upon the requeſt of ſome wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Friends, who judged it neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſince the Reprinting of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Tranſlation. Beſides, the faults of the Tranſlator, in the new Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion there are great ones commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Printer, in the <hi>Techni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal words</hi> of the Diſcourſe, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly in the beginning of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Page, he hath printed <hi>Veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> inſtead of <hi>Variety.</hi> At the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
<pb facs="tcp:66341:6"/>
of thoſe Gentlemen I reſolved to Review and Print my Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the Authors Text, that the Reader might have it in his Power, to judge of my Fidelity therein. And though I ſee no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be proud of my performance, yet I perſuade my ſelf this Book will be ſomewhat more uſeful, than that which now goes abroad.</p>
                  <p>In the Diſſertation prefixed, I have Collected all the little Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Paſſages I have met with any where, touching our Author and his Works, and perhaps the Reader may think, I inſiſt too long upon ſome matters of no great moment. But in regard <hi>Ratramnus</hi> was an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Man, and no Body, that I know, hath in our Language, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven any conſiderable account of him, and his Writings, I thought it would not be altogether unacceptable to the Reader.</p>
                  <p>Though the <hi>French</hi> Advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be exceedingly well done, yet I have had great helps, for the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                     <p>
                        <pb n="22" facs="tcp:66341:20"/>The appearance of an Author near 700 years old, and ſo expreſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting their Doctrine, put the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Doctors into great confuſion. They all ſaw it was neceſſary to take ſome courſe to deprive the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of the advantage they were likely to make of ſo material a Witneſs againſt them: But they were very much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided in their Opinions, what courſe would prove moſt effectual.</p>
                     <p>Some have condemned the Author for an Heretick, which is a quick and ſure way to invalidate his Teſtimony in a point of Faith.</p>
                     <p>Others have ſpared the Author, but condemned the Book for Spuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as well as Heretical, or at leaſt as corrupted by the Diſciples of <hi>Beren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garius</hi> and <hi>Wiclef.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Others ſay, that it is not the Work of <hi>Ratramne,</hi> Monk of <hi>Corbey,</hi> but of <hi>Joannes Scotus Erigena.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And laſtly, their moſt Learned Writers of this preſent Age, allow the Book to be <hi>Bertram</hi>'s, and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſome raſh expreſſions in it, which may bear a Catholick ſenſe, acknowledge the Work as well as its Author to be Orthodox, and ſay, he doth not oppoſe the preſent Doctrin
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:66341:20"/>
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, being rather for Tranſubſtantiation, than againſt it.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore to vindicate this Work from our Adverſaries, who uſe ſo many tricks to wreſt it out of our hands, I ſhall endeavour theſe five things.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. To ſhew that <hi>Ratramnus</hi> was Orthodox, and free from all juſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Hereſie.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. To prove that this Treatiſe is a genuine piece of the IX. Century, that it hath not been maliciouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved ſince thoſe times, and that <hi>Ratramnus,</hi> and not <hi>Joannes Scotus Eri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gena,</hi> is the Author thereof.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. To ſettle the true ſence of our Author, in ſome obſcure and contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted terms.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. To prove, that the Doctre in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered in this Book, is contrary to that of <hi>Paſchaſius,</hi> and the preſent <hi>Roman</hi> Church, but very agreeable to the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. To ſhew that he was not ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar in his Doctrine, but that other Great Men of that and the next Age, were of the ſame Judgment with him.</p>

                                    <hi>p.</hi> 33. So the Holy Font-Water, which is called the Well-Spring of Life, is like in ſhape to other Water,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:66341:30"/>
and ſubject to corruption, but the Holy Ghoſts might cometh to the corruptible Water through the Prieſt bleſſing, and it may after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards waſh the Body and Soul from all ſin through Ghoſtly might.</p>
                                 <p>Behold, now we ſee two things in this one Creature. After true nature, that Water is corruptible moiſture; and after Ghoſtly Myſtery, hath hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing might.</p>
                                 <p>So alſo if we behold the Holy Houſel [or Sacrament] after bodily ſenſe, then we ſee that it is a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture corruptible and mutable; if we acknowledge therein Ghoſtly might, then underſtand we that Life is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and that it giveth immortality to them that eat it with Faith.</p>
                                 <p>
                                    <hi>p.</hi> 35. Much difference is betwixt the Body in which Chriſt ſuffered, and the Body which is hallowed to hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel. The Body truly in which Chriſt ſuffered, was born of the Fleſh of <hi>Mary,</hi> with Blood, with Bones, with Skin, with Sinews, with human Limbs, and with a reaſonable Soul
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:66341:31"/>
living. And his Ghoſtly Body, which we call the Houſel,<note place="margin">p. 36.</note> is gathered of many Corns without Blood and Bone, without Limb, and without Soul— whatſoever is in that Houſel that giveth the ſubſtance of Life, that is of the Ghoſtly might and inviſible operation. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is the Holy Houſel called a My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, becauſe there is one thing in it ſeen, and another thing underſtood.</p>
                                 <p>
                                    <hi>p.</hi> 37. Certainly Chriſt's Body, in which he ſuffered Death, and roſe again from Death, never dieth henceforth, but is Eternal and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſible. But that Houſel is Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, not Eternal; corruptible, and divided into ſeveral parts, chew'd betwixt the Teeth, and ſent into the Belly.</p>
                                 <p>
                                    <hi>p.</hi> 38. This Myſtery is a pledge and a<note n="*" place="margin">
                                       <hi>Hip,</hi> and not as above <hi>getac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunge,</hi> which is a figure in ſpeech.</note> Figure, Chriſt's Body is the Truth itſelf. This Pledge we keep myſtically, until we be come to the

Truth itſelf, then is that Pledge ended.</p>
                                 <p>Truly it is ſo as we ſaid before, Chriſt's Body and Blood not Bodily but Ghoſtly. See <hi>p.</hi> 35.</p>

                                    <hi>p.</hi> 43. We ſaid to you erewhile, that Chriſt hallowed Bread and Wine to Houſel before his Suffering, and ſaid, This is my Body and my Blood. He had not ſuffered as yet, he turned through inviſible might that Bread to his own Body, and that Wine to his own Blood, as formerly he did in the Wilderneſs before that he was born to Men, when he turned that Heavenly Meat to his Fleſh, and that Water flowing from the Rock to his own Blood.</p>
                                 <p>That which next follows, is a quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation out of St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> which it is very likely that <hi>Elfrick</hi> took from <hi>Bertram,</hi> and not at firſt hand from that Father.</p>

                                    <hi>p.</hi> 44. <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> and many others of that People which pleaſed God, eat that Heavenly Bread, and they died not that Everlaſting death, [though they died the common death] they ſaw that the Heavenly Meat <hi>[viz.

                                 <p>
                                    <hi>p.</hi> 46. Once Chriſt ſuffered in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and yet nevertheleſs his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is daily renewed, through the Myſtery of the Holy Houſel at the Holy Maſs.</p>

But it ſeems the ſucceeding Ages would not bear this Doctrine, for which reaſon the <hi>Latin</hi> is utterly loſt; either being wilfully made away, or the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors of our Church not thinking it fit to tranſcribe and propagate what, after the condemnation of <hi>Berenga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> and the promotion of his great Adverſary <hi>Lanfranc</hi> to the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> was generally reputed Hereſie. But through the wonderful good Providence of God, the whole is preſerved in the <hi>Saxon</hi> Tongue, which few underſtood.</p>
                     <p>By this account of that Homily, you learn Two things, and a Third Obſervation I ſhall add.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That <hi>Bertram</hi>'s Book was neither forged by <hi>Oecolampadius,</hi> nor yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved by <hi>Berengarius</hi> or <hi>Wiclef</hi> his Diſciples, ſince the moſt expreſs Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages againſt the Popiſh <hi>Real Preſence</hi>
                        <pb n="53" facs="tcp:66341:35"/>
are read in that Homily 70 or 80 years before <hi>Berengarius</hi> made any noiſe in the World.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. What I deſign to inſiſt upon more largely in the laſt Chapter of this Diſcourſe, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Ratramnus</hi> or <hi>Bertram</hi> ſtood not alone, but had others of the ſame judgment with him in the IX and X Century, and that <hi>Paſchaſius</hi> his Doctrine had not recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as yet the ſtamp of publick Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, either by any Popes or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels confirmation.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Nevertheleſs this carnal Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Paſchaſius</hi> did daily get ground in that obſcure and ignorant Age next that he lived in, as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by ſome Paſſages in this Homily (which I have not recited, becauſe they are not in <hi>Bertram</hi>) the abſurd conſequences of that errour. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, <hi>p.</hi> 39 and 40, there are two Miracles inſerted to prove the Carnal Preſence contrary to the ſcope of the whole Diſcourſe, and the one contrary to their own Doctrine of Chriſt's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.<note n="(a)" place="bottom">
                           <hi>This Miracle is found in</hi> Paſchaſ Radbert. de Corp. &amp; Sang. Dom. in Bibl. Patrum. Par. <hi>1610.</hi> Tom. VI. c. <hi>14.</hi>

                        <hi>whole Body, Soul and Divinity is in every bit of the Host, and drop of the conſecrated Wine;</hi> and this Miracle, if it proves any thing, muſt prove the contrary.</p>
                     <p>Again, our Homiliſt in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>p.</hi> 47. ſaith immediatly after thoſe words cited by me out of the 46 page. <hi>Therefore the Holy Maſs is profitable both to the quick and to the dead.</hi> The propitiatory Sacrifice was by this time ſet on foot, which neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily ſuppoſeth the Corporal Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Chriſt. But it is worth ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving, however, that the Adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Sacrament ſprang not up till ſome Ages after, it being not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned either by <hi>Radbertus</hi> or <hi>Ratram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> or <hi>Elfrick</hi> in this Homily.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Third Opinion, maintained by thoſe who do not condemn our Author, though they do this Book, is, that it is not the Work of <hi>Ratramnus,</hi> but of <hi>Joannes Scotus.</hi> And ſo it may
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:66341:36"/>
be for ought I have hitherto ſaid, in regard he was more Ancient than our <hi>Saxon</hi> Homiliſt, and equal with <hi>Bertram.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Opinion was firſt delivered by the Learned<note n="(a)" place="bottom">P. de Marca in Epiſtola. Apud Dacherium in Spicil. Tom. <hi>2.</hi>

                        </note> Monk of St. <hi>Genouefe,</hi> whoſe Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty <hi>M. Arnaud</hi> tells us cauſed him to conceal his Name.</p>
                     <p>This Diſſertator makes a great duſt with his Conjectures, and would perſwade us that <hi>Bertram</hi> and <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tramnus</hi> are not the ſame Perſon, by reaſon of the variety of Names given him, as I have ſhewn in the beginning of this Diſcourſe; but this is a poor ſhift, for every one knows how diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently Writers report the Names of Men who flouriſh'd in that Age, and in thoſe Parts of <hi>France;</hi> and where the Authors make no difference, it often happens by the Tranſcribers miſtake: One would think the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance he gives of <hi>Cellot</hi>'s Anonymous Writer, who in his firſt leaf calls the Adverſaries of <hi>Paſchaſius, Rabanus</hi> and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:66341:37"/>
                        <hi>Ratramnus,</hi> and in the next <hi>Babanus</hi> and <hi>Intramus,</hi> might have ſuppreſſed that Objection.</p>
                     <p>In the next Section, he ſaith, <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>themius</hi> and <hi>Sigebert</hi> make <hi>Bertram</hi> to have written but one Book of Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination, whereas <hi>Ratramnus</hi> wrote two, and that the two MSS. mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by <hi>Suffridus Petrus,</hi> may be falſe written: And I may better ſay, they are not; for he names neither more, nor elder Copies that make it out. As for the preciſe number of Books, <hi>Sigebert,</hi> and more curious Men, are not always exact, but many times, where the Work is ſmall, call two Books,<note place="margin">Ad Carolum librum de Praedeſtin.</note> becauſe one Work, <hi>a Book,</hi> ſo <hi>Sigebert</hi> ſaith, and not <hi>one Book.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In his Third Section, this Monk of St. <hi>Genouefe</hi> gives us nothing but a taſte of his Modeſty, in taxing the incomparable <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> of falſe dealing, and telling the World that his Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony is of no credit concerning a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure out of a Manuſcript he had ſeen at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and wonders he hath the confidence to hope that his bare word ſhould be taken for it, after his falſe dealing about <hi>Ratramnus</hi> his Book of <hi>Chriſt's Birth,</hi> without telling how the Paſſage raſed was recovered.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="57" facs="tcp:66341:37"/>In the laſt Section, he offers to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward an Anſwer to the Reaſons that induced Father <hi>Cellot</hi> to conclude <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tramnus Corbeienſis</hi> the Author of thoſe Books which paſs under the Name of <hi>Bertram;</hi> I could, were it worth while, ſhew the inſufficiency of his Anſwers, and would do it, but that I have in reſerve ſuch Teſtimonies from F. <hi>Mabillon,</hi> as will baffle all his amuſing Conjectures, and to which any man of <hi>modeſty</hi> will ſubmit.</p>
                     <p>This he offers to prove, that <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tram</hi> is not <hi>Ratramnus.</hi> To make good the other part of his undertaking, and ſhew that <hi>Joannes Scotus</hi> is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of this Book, he ſuggeſts Three things.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That this Book is agreeable to the account that is given of <hi>Scotus</hi> his Book, whoſe Authority <hi>Berengarius</hi> uſed.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That the ſtyle and manner of arguing, are <hi>Scotus</hi> his peculiar way.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That the Diſciples of <hi>Berenga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> after <hi>Scotus</hi> his Book was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, in the Synods at <hi>Vercelli</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> gave it the diſguiſed Name of
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:66341:38"/>
                        <hi>Bertram,</hi> to preſerve it from the flames.</p>
                     <p>His Arguments from the account given of <hi>Scotus</hi> his Book, are well anſwered by F. <hi>Mabillon;</hi> and all I ſhall ſay, is, what he omits, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Doctrine of <hi>Scotus,</hi> according to the beſt accounts we can have of it, is not agreeable to that of <hi>Bertram;</hi> for if F. <hi>Alexander</hi> and others are not Miſtaken in<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Quod Sacramenta Altaris non verum Corpus &amp; verus Sanguis ſit Domini, ſed tantum memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria veri Corporis &amp; Sanguinis ejus, de Praed. c. <hi>31.</hi>

                        <hi>Hincmarus</hi> his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he taught that the <hi>Sacrament was only a Memory of Chriſt's Body and Blood,</hi> which this Diſſertator, to give us a Specimen of his <hi>Honeſty,</hi> as he did before of his <hi>Modeſty,</hi> changes into a <hi>naked figure without any ſort of Truth,</hi> and expreſly contrary to his Sentiments, imputes to <hi>Bertram</hi> as his Doctrine.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The ſtyle of <hi>Bertram</hi> and <hi>Scotus</hi> are not at all alike: <hi>Scotus</hi> is full of Greek words, and notions and cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions out of the Greek Fathers, which <hi>Bertram</hi> is free from. His way of
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:66341:38"/>
Arguing is not Syllogiſtical, as <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tram</hi>'s, ſo far as I can obſerve by his Books <hi>De Naturis.</hi> And his notion,<note place="margin">Scotus de Diviſione Naturae, l. <hi>5</hi> N. XX. I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem l. <hi>2.</hi> n. XI.</note> That <hi>Chriſt's glorified Body is abſorpt in the Divine Nature, and is not local, nor viſible, nor had the ſame Members after its Reſurrection which it had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</hi> will quite overthrow many of <hi>Bertram</hi>'s Arguments, to prove that in the Sacrament is not exhibited the ſame Body in which he died and roſe again.</p>
                     <p>His Third ſuggeſtion is a meer Conjecture, and a very weak one. For if <hi>Berengarius</hi> his Diſciples feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that Name to preſerve the Book from the fire, What uſe did they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it for? What ſervice did it ever do them? Who ever mentions any of them that alledged <hi>Bertram</hi>'s Authority? How comes it to paſs that no Copies of it were preſerved in the Southern Parts of <hi>France,</hi> where the <hi>Albigenſes</hi> and <hi>Waldenſes, Berengarius</hi> Diſciples, have abounded in all times ever ſince? It is much they ſhould not ſave one Copy of <hi>Bertram.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But ſince he is Conjecturing, Why may not I offer a Conjecture or two in this matter? 1. Why might not
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:66341:39"/>

                     </p>
                     <p>The word <hi>Figure,</hi> when applied to <hi>Terms</hi> or <hi>Propoſitions,</hi> is taken in a Rhetorical ſenſe, and implies thoſe Expreſſions not to be <hi>proper,</hi> but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Metaphors,</hi> or <hi>Metonymies,</hi> &amp;c. as when <hi>Christ</hi> is called a <hi>Vine.</hi> When applied to <hi>things,</hi> as the <hi>conſecrated Elements, Figure</hi> and <hi>Myſtery</hi> are of the ſame ſignification, and imply the thing ſpoken of to be a <hi>Sign</hi> or <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation</hi> of ſome other thing.<note place="margin">Verity or Truth.</note> And on the contrary, <hi>Verity</hi> or <hi>Truth</hi> in

                           <hi>In Proprietate, Subſtantialiter, in manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis, Luce in veritatis ſimplicitate,</hi> in this Tract, are equivalent to naturally, and in Verity of Nature.

                        <hi>Truth of Nature.</hi> So then <hi>Ratramnus</hi> determines the firſt Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion to this effect. That the words of our Saviour in the Inſtitution of the Holy Euchariſt, are not to be taken <hi>properly,</hi> but <hi>figuratively;</hi> and that the conſecrated Elements orally received by the Faithful, are not the <hi>True</hi> Body of Chriſt, but the <hi>Figure,</hi> or Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it; though not meer empty figures, or naked ſigns, void of all Efficacy, but ſuch as through the Bleſſing annext to our Saviour's Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and the powerful operation of the Spirit of Chriſt working in and by thoſe Sacred Figures, is the Communion of the Body and Blood of Chriſt.</p>

                        <hi>Verity</hi> or <hi>Truth</hi> hath yet another ſence, as it ſtands oppoſed to a <hi>Lye</hi> or <hi>Falſhood:</hi> For a Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not immediately falſe, where the Praedicate is a <hi>Metaphor</hi> or <hi>Meto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymy,</hi> and doth not in its firſt and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſignification agree to the ſubject; for unleſs the Trope be too obſcure, it conveys the Speakers true meaning into the mind of ſuch as hear him.</p>

But yet <hi>Bertram</hi>'s ſence of the word muſt be judged by his own uſe of it, which will appear by inſpecting the ſeveral places of the Book where it occurs; and I muſt needs ſay, that I cannot make ſence of him, if he mean not as the <hi>French</hi> Tranſlator hath rendred him.</p>
                     <p>In the ſtate of the queſtion, where he explains <hi>Verity,</hi> by that which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears <hi>manifeſtationis luce, in a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:66341:43"/>
light,</hi> or <hi>naked and open,</hi> his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in that Queſtion, (or rather the meaning of thoſe againſt whom he writes, and whoſe error the firſt part of this Diſcourſe is intended to recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie) cannot be; whether the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was the Body of Chriſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in its own ſhape to our bodily Eye: For that Cardinal <hi>Perron,</hi> or Mr. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud</hi> do not pretend the <hi>Stercorariſts,</hi> or whoever elſe <hi>Bertram</hi> oppoſeth, to have believed, but that the accidents of Bread and Wine affected, or were ſubjected in the natural Body and Blood of Chriſt. Now as to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Manifeſt appearance of Chriſt's Body, it is all one, whether the accidents of Bread and Wine be ſubjected in the Body and Blood of Chriſt, or ſubſiſt without a ſubject; for the bodily Eye doth not behold the Body of Chriſt, the more or leſs manifeſtly for that; nor doth it at all <hi>manifeſtly</hi> behold Chriſt's Body, unleſs it ſee him in the form of a Man. And therefore if they meant any thing, it muſt be, whether the ſenſible Object in the Sacrament were Chriſt's very Body, though under the figure of the Sacramental Elements.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="70" facs="tcp:66341:44"/>But to clear the point, we need only compare the two Prayers in the cloſe of <hi>Bertram</hi>'s Diſcourſe on the ſecond Queſtion, and we ſhall find, that what in one Prayer they beg of God to receive by a <hi>manifeſt participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> in the other they pray to be made <hi>really partakers of;</hi> and in the ſame Collect, <hi>manifeſt participation</hi> is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to Receiving in a <hi>Sacramental Image:</hi> Now there is nothing more na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally oppoſed to an <hi>Image,</hi> than the <hi>very thing</hi> whoſe Image it is, or to a Sacrament, than the <hi>res Sacramenti,</hi> the real Object ſignified and exhibited under it. The Reader will find the word bears the ſame ſence in thoſe few other places where <hi>Ratramnus</hi> uſeth it, which are all near the end of the Book.</p>
                     <p>Another controverted Term is <hi>Species,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Species.</note> which hath two ſences in this Book. It is moſt commonly uſed to ſignifie <hi>the kind,</hi> and <hi>ſpecifical nature</hi> of any thing, and is always ſo taken where it is ſet in oppoſition to a <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure,</hi> or <hi>Sacrament,</hi> or where the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor is declaring the nature of the conſecrated Elements.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes it ſignifies the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or likeneſs of a thing; ſo it is
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:66341:44"/>
taken when it is oppoſed to <hi>Truth,</hi> as in the Poſt-Communion Prayer cited by <hi>Ratramnus,</hi> and in his Inferences from it.</p>
                     <p>Beſides theſe, the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> have another acceptation of the word, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it to ſignifie the ſenſible qualities of the conſecrated Elements ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without their ſubſtance, in which ſence I poſitively affirm, that <hi>Species</hi> is no where uſed in this Treatiſe. And herein the Authors of the<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Index Expurg.

                        <hi>Belgick</hi> Index will bear me out, <hi>who acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that</hi> Bertram <hi>did not exastly know how Accidents could ſubſist out of their Subjects, which ſubtil Truth latter Ages have learnt out of the Scripture.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As <hi>Species</hi> ordinarily ſignifies Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,<note place="margin">Species Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibilis.</note> ſo the addition of <hi>Viſibilis</hi> alters not its ſignification. For <hi>Ratramnus</hi> doth not ſpeak of thoſe qualities which immediately affect the ſence abſtracted from their Subject. And I know nothing in Reaſon, nor yet in the Holy Scriptures, which are the Rule of our Faith, that can inforce us to believe that our Senſes are not
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:66341:45"/>
as true Judges of what the Mouth receiveth in the Sacrament, as they are of the nature of any other Object whatſoever, and may as eaſily diſcern whether it be Bread or Fleſh, as they can diſtinguiſh a Man from a Tree.</p>
                     <p>Our Author frequently mentions the <hi>Divine Word,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Divine Word.</note> by whoſe power the Sacred Elements are <hi>Spiritually changed</hi> into Chriſt's Body. Now when he thus ſpeaks, we muſt not imagine, that he means a natural change of the Subſtance of the thing conſecrated by the <hi>efficacy of the words of conſecration,</hi> but a Spiritual change effected by the Power and Spirit of Chriſt, who is <hi>God the Word,</hi> as he explains himſelf.</p>
                     <p>The laſt Term that needs explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,<note place="margin">Spiriutal Body.</note> is Chriſt's <hi>Spiritual Body;</hi> this he affirms the Sacrament to be in many places. Now by a <hi>Spiritual Body,</hi> we are not to underſtand the natural Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chriſt, but exiſting after the manner of a Spirit, or as our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries love to ſpeak, not according to its proper exiſtence, that is to ſay, it is Chriſt's Natural Body, but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther viſible nor local, nor extended; this is not <hi>Bertram</hi>'s ſence of <hi>Chriſt's Spiritual Body,</hi> but that the thing ſo
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:66341:45"/>
called, is <hi>Figuratively</hi> and <hi>Myſtically</hi> Chriſt's Body, and that it <hi>Spiritually</hi> communicates to the Faithful, <hi>Christ with all the benefits of his Death.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I may alſo add, that <hi>Bertram</hi> uſes great variety of Phraſes to expreſs that which we call the outward ſign in the Sacrament, <hi>that which the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſenſe beholds, that which the bodily eye ſeeth, that which is outwardly ſeen or done corporeal, that which the Teeth preſs, or the Mouth receives, that which feeds the Body, that which appears out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly,</hi> importing the ſenſible quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to be all that we have to judge the nature of viſible Objects by, its extenſion and figure, its colour, its ſmell, its taſte, its ſolidity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> None of thoſe Phraſes imply the Accidents without the Subſtance, but they are deſcriptions of the Sacramental Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bols or outward Signs.</p>
                     <p>And to theſe are oppoſed, <hi>that which faith, or the eyes of the mind only beholds, that which we believe, that which is inwardly contained, or Spiritually ſeen or done, that which faith receives, the ſecret vertue latent in the Sacrament, the ſaving benefits of it, that which feeds the Soul, and miniſters the Suſtenance of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life,</hi> all expreſſions equivalent to

                     <p>Upon the receipt of this, it is high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly probable, that <hi>Carolus Calvus</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded thoſe two Queſtions to <hi>Ratramnus,</hi> and upon his Anſwer thoſe feuds might grow in the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery of <hi>Corbey,</hi> which made <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſius</hi> weary of the Place, and reſign his Abby in the year 851. in which

                     <p n="1">1. He aſſerts that what is orally received, is not the true and natural Body of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. He aſſerts that the ſubſtance of Bread and Wine remain after Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. It is very plain from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of the ſecond Queſtion, that <hi>Bertram</hi> expreſly contradicts <hi>Paſchaſius,</hi> for the words of the Queſtion, are taken out of his book, and <hi>Bertram</hi> denies flatly what <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſius</hi> affirms, <hi>viz.

                        <hi>in nature and appearance,</hi> and another thing in <hi>ſignification.</hi> Likewiſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding St. <hi>Hieroms</hi> Teſtimony, he ſaith, <hi>Christs natural body had all the organical parts of an humane body, and was quickened with a reaſonable ſoul, whereas his body in the Sacrament hath neither.</hi> He makes the body of Chriſt in the Sacrament to be <hi>only an Image or Pledge,</hi> but the Natural body of Chriſt <hi>to be the Truth ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</hi> And in the firſt part he proves that the words of Chriſt Inſtituting this Sacrament are <hi>Figurative,</hi> and that the thing orally received, or the <hi>Symbols had the name of the things ſignified thereby, it being uſual to give Signs or Sacraments the name of the very thing repreſented under them.</hi> And this he proves from St. <hi>Augustine.</hi> It muſt be acknowledged, that <hi>Bertram</hi> ſometimes ſaith, <hi>that it is truly Chriſts body and blood;</hi> but mark how he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains himſelf, he ſaith, they are not ſo <hi>as to their viſible nature,</hi> but <hi>by the power of the Divine Word, i. e.</hi> not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally, but ſpiritually: And he adds, the <hi>viſible creature feeds the body, but the virtue and efficacy of the Divine Word, feeds and ſanctifies the ſoul of the Faithful.</hi> So that when he affirms
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:66341:53"/>
the Sacrament to be truly Chriſts body, he means <hi>truly</hi> in oppoſition to <hi>falſhood,</hi> not <hi>truly</hi> as that word is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to <hi>Figuratively.</hi>

                     <p>But <hi>F. Mabillon,</hi> and <hi>F.

                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher,</hi> and impute this Opinion of his, to the prejudice of Education. For its very evident, that what <hi>Ratramnus</hi> labours to prove, is an <hi>eſſential diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> between the Sacrament recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the Faithful and Chriſts bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as great a difference, as between a <hi>body</hi> and a <hi>ſpirit,</hi> between a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible and an incorruptible thing, between the <hi>Image</hi> and the Original <hi>Truth,</hi> between <hi>Figure</hi> and <hi>Verity:</hi> And it is as plain, that he admits theſe ſenſible qualities to be clear proofs of an eſſential difference, and alſo allows our outward ſenſes to be proper Judges in the caſe, appealing

to our eyes, our taſte and ſmell,<note n="*" place="bottom">Sect. 99.

And whether it be the ſame Body which was Born of <hi>Mary,</hi> and Suffered, Died, and was Buried, and Riſing again and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending into Heaven, ſits at the Right Hand of the Father.</p>

                     <p n="7">VII.<note place="margin">What a Figure is.</note> A <hi>Figure</hi> is a certain covert manner of Expreſſion, which exhibits what it intends under certain Vails. For example; We call the <hi>Word,

                     <p n="8">VIII. <hi>The Truth</hi> is the Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the very thing it ſelf, not vail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with any Shadow or Figure, but expreſſed according to the pure and naked (or to ſpeak more plainly yet) natural Signification of the words. As when we ſay that Chriſt was Born of a Virgin, Suffered, was Crucified, Dead and Buried: Here is nothing ſhadowed out under the cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Figures, but the very Truth of the thing is expreſſed, according to the natural Signification of the words; nor is any thing here under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood but what is ſaid.

                           <hi>i.e.</hi> In propriety of Nature: So the Saxon Homily, Aefter soðum gecynd nis Crist naþor ne hlaf.</note> in Subſtance, neither is Chriſt <hi>Bread,</hi> or a <hi>Vine,</hi> nor the Apoſtles

                     <p n="9">IX.<note place="margin">He proves the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be a Figure from the notion of a Myſtery or a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</note> Now let us return to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject which hath occaſioned the ſaying of all this, <hi>viz.</hi> the Body and Blood of Chriſt. If there be no figure in that Myſtery, it is not properly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Myſtery; for that cannot be ſaid to be a Myſtery, which hath nothing ſecret, nothing remote from our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily Senſes, nothing covered under any Vail. But as for that Bread which by the Miniſtry of the Prieſt, is made Chriſt's Body, it ſheweth one thing outwardly to our Senſes, and inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proclaims quite another thing to the minds of the Faithful. That which outwardly appears is Bread, as it was before in Form, Colour and Taſte: But inwardly there is quite another thing preſented to us, and that much more precious and excellent, becauſe it is Heavenly and Divine: That is, Chriſt's Body is exhibited which is beheld, received, and eaten,, not by our carnal Senſes, but by the ſight of the believing Soul.</p>
                     <p n="10">X. Likewiſe the Wine, which by the Prieſts Conſecration, is made the Sacrament of Chriſt's Blood, appears
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:66341:80"/>
one thing outwardly, and inwardly contains another: For what doth outwardly appear but the ſubſtance of Wine? Taſt it, there is the reliſh of Wine; ſmell it, there is the ſcent of Wine; behold it, there is the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of Wine. But if you conſider it inwardly, then it is not the Liquor of Wine, but the Liquor of Chriſt's Blood, which is Taſted, Seen, and Smelt. Since theſe things are unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable, 'tis evident, that the Bread and Wine are <hi>Figuratively</hi> the Body and Blood of Chriſt: As to outward appearance, there is neither the Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Fleſh to be ſeen in that Bread, nor the Liquor of Blood in that Wine, and yet after the myſtical Conſecration, they are no longer called Bread and Wine, but the Body and Blood of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="11">XI.<note place="margin">Another Argument from the nature of Faith.</note> If according to the Opinion of ſome Men, here is nothing Figurative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken, but the whole Matter is real, then Faith operates nothing, here is nothing Spiritual done, but the whole is to be underſtood altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther corporally. And ſeeing<note n="*" place="bottom">Heb. 11.1.</note>

In what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect is this change made, ſo that the things are not now what they were before, to wit, Bread and Wine, but the Body and Blood of Chriſt? For as to the Nature of the Creature, and the form of the viſible things, both (to wit) the Bread and Wine, have nothing changed in them. And if they have undergone no change, they are nothing but what they were before.</p>

And if they now are other than they were before, they have admitted ſome change. This [inference] being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable, let them now tell us, in what reſpect they are changed?

ſome other reſpect than that of their Bodies, and in this reſpect <hi>they are,</hi> what we ſee <hi>they are not in truth,</hi> but ſomewhat elſe, which we diſcern them <hi>not to be in their proper Eſſence,</hi> or if they will not acknowledge this, they will be compelled to deny that they are Chriſt's Body and Blood; which is abominable not only to ſpeak, but even to think.</p>
                     <p n="16">XVI. But ſince they do confeſs them to be the Body and Blood of Chriſt, which they could not have been, but by a change for the better, nor is this change wrought Corporally, but Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually: It muſt neceſſarily be ſaid to be wrought <hi>Figuratively.</hi> Becauſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Vail of material Bread, and material Wine; the Spiritual Body, and Spiritual Blood of Chriſt do exiſt: Not that there are together exiſting, two natures ſo different, as a Body and Spirit: But one and the ſame thing, in one reſpect, hath the nature of Bread and Wine; and in another reſpect, is the Body and Blood of Chriſt. For both as they are Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally handled, are in their nature Corporeal Creatures; but according to their Virtue, and what they are Spiritually made, they are <hi>Myſteries</hi>

                     <p n="17">XVII. Let us conſider the Font of holy Baptiſm,<note place="margin">He Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates the matter by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the two Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and the Lord's Body.</note> which is not undeſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly ſtiled the Fountain of Life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it regenerates thoſe who deſcend into it, to the Newneſs of a better Life; and makes thoſe who were dead in Sins, alive unto Righteouſneſs. Is it the viſible Element of Water which hath this efficacy? Verily, unleſs it had obtained a Sanctifying virtue, it could by no means waſh away the ſtain of our Sins: And if it had not a quickning Power, it could not at all give Life to the Dead. The Dead, I mean not as to their Bodies, but their Souls. Yet if in that Fountain you conſider nothing but what the bodily Senſe beholdeth, you ſee only a fluid Element of a corruptible Nature, and capable of waſhing the Body on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. But the Power of the Holy Ghoſt, came upon it by the Prieſts Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp; it obtained thereby an efficacy to waſh not the Bodies only, but alſo the Souls of Men; and by a Spitual vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, to take away their Spiritual filth.</p>
                     <p n="18">XVIII. Behold, how in one and the ſame Element, are ſeen two things contrary to each other; a thing Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible, giving Incorruption; and a
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:66341:86"/>
thing without Life, giving Life. It is manifeſt then, that in the Font, there is both ſomewhat, which the bodily ſenſe perceiveth, which is therefore mutable and corruptible; and ſomewhat which the Eye of Faith only beholds, and therefore is neither Corruptible nor Mortal. If you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire what waſhes the outſide, it is the Element; but if you conſider what purgeth the inſide, it is a quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning power, a Sanctifying power, a power conferring Immortality. So then in its own nature, it is a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible Liquor, but in the Myſtery 'tis a Healing Power.</p>
                     <p n="19">XIX. Thus alſo the Body and Blood of Chriſt, conſidered as to the outſide only, is a creature ſubject to change and Corruption. But if you ponder the efficacy of the Myſtery, it is Life conferring Immortality, on ſuch as partake thereof. Therefore they are not the ſame things which are ſeen, and which are believed. For the things ſeen, feed a Corruptible Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, being corruptible themſelves. But thoſe which are believed, feed immortal Souls, being themſelves immortal.</p>

Now could the Sea, as a viſible Element, have the power of Baptizing? Or could the Cloud as a condenſation of the Air, Sanctifie the People? And yet we dare not ſay, but that the Apoſtle who ſpake in Chriſt, did truly affirm, that our Fathers were Baptized in the Cloud, and in the Sea.</p>
                     <p n="21">XXI. And although that Baptiſm was not the ſame with the Chriſtian Baptiſm, now Celebrated in the Church, yet that it was Baptiſm, and that our Fathers were therewith Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, no Man in his Wits will deny.
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:66341:88"/>
None but a man that would preſume expreſly to contradict the Words of the Apoſtle: Therefore the <hi>Sea</hi> and <hi>Cloud</hi> did ſanctifie and cleanſe; not as they were meer bodily Subſtances, but as they did inviſibly contain the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying Power of the Holy Ghoſt: For there was in them both a viſible Form appearing to the bodily Eyes, not in Image, but in Truth; and alſo a ſpiritual Virtue, ſhining within, which was not diſcernable by the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily Eyes, but by thoſe of the Mind.</p>
                     <p n="22">XXII. Likewiſe the Manna which was given the People from Heaven, and the Water flowing out of the Rock, were corporeal Subſtances, and were both meat and Drink for the nouriſhment of the Peoples Bodies.

Becauſe there was in thoſe bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Subſtances a ſpiritual Power of the Word, which rather feed and gave Drink to the minds, than the Bodies of the Faithful.

The Apoſtle intending to intimate thus much, when he had ſaid that our Fathers did eat the ſame Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Meat, and drank the ſame Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Drink; he adds, <hi>And they all drank of that Spiritual Rock which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them, and that Rock was Chriſt:</hi> To the end we might underſtand, that in the Wilderneſs Chriſt was in the Spiritual Rock, and gave the Liquor of his Blood to the People; who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards<note n="*" place="margin">That is under the Goſpel.</note> in our times exhibited his Body, born of a Virgin, and Crucified for the Salvation of ſuch as believe; out of which he ſhed ſtreams of Blood,

<pb n="209" facs="tcp:66341:113"/>
was his true Body, that is, it remained ſuch as might be ſeen and felt; but the Body, which is called the Myſtery of God, is not Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real, but Spiritual; and if Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, then it can neither be ſeen, nor yet felt. And for this reaſon St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> proceeds to ſay, <hi>The Body of Chriſt is the Body of a Divine Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi> Now, a Divine Spirit is no Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal, Corruptible, or palpable Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: But that Body which is cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated in the Church, according to its viſible Nature, is both Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible, and ſuch as may be felt.</p>
                     <p n="63">LXIII. In what reſpect then is it called the Body of a Divine Spirit? Truly, as it is Spiritual, that is, as it is inviſible; as it cannot be felt, and is therefore incorruptible.</p>
                     <p n="64">LXIV. Which makes him further add, That Chriſt is a Spirit; as we read, <hi>Chriſt, the Lord, is the Spirit before our Face.</hi> Whereby he plainly ſhews, in what reſpect it is accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Chriſt's Body, to wit, in as much as the Spirit of Chriſt is therein, that is to ſay, the Power of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Word, which doth not only feed, but alſo purifies the Soul.</p>
                     <p n="65">
                        <pb n="211" facs="tcp:66341:114"/>LXV. Wherefore our Author goes on: <hi>Lastly this Meat ſtrengtheneth our Heart, and this Drink maketh glad the Heart of Man, as the</hi>

                        <hi>Prophet teſtifies.</hi> Now doth our Bodily Food ſtrengthen, or doth this Bodily Drink make glad the Heart of Man? But to ſhew of what Meat and Drink it is that he ſpeaks, he adds empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically: <hi>This Meat, and this Drink.</hi> What is this Meat, and this Drink? Even the Body of Chriſt, the Body of the Divine Spirit; and (to explain the Matter yet more) Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who is a Spirit, of whom he ſaith, <hi>Chriſt, the Lord, is the Spirit before our Face.</hi> By all which Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, it evidently appears, that in this Meat and Drink, nothing is to be corporally underſtood; but all muſt be Spiritually taken.</p>
                     <p n="66">LXVI. For the Soul, which is in this place ſignified by the Heart of Man, is not fed with bodily Meat, or Drink; but is nouriſhed by the Word of God, and grows thereby. Which the ſame Doctor doth more expreſly affirm in his Fifth Book up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Sacraments, ſaying, <hi>It is not that Bread which goes into the Body,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:66341:115"/>
but the Bread of Life Eternal, which affords Suſtenance to our Souls.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="67">LXVII. And that St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſpake not this of common Bread; but of that Bread which is alſo Chriſt's Body, is moſt manifeſt from the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Paſſages: For he ſpeaks of the Daily Bread, which the Faithful pray for.</p>
                     <p n="68">LXVIII. Adding, If it be <hi>Daily Bread, why doſt thou receive it but once in the Year, as the</hi> Greeks <hi>in the Eaſt were wont to do? Receive that every Day, which may every Day do thee good; and live ſo, that thou mayeſt be every Day worthy to receive.</hi> So that it is plain of what Bread he ſpeaks, to wit, of the Bread of Chriſt's Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which ſuſtains our Souls, not as it paſſes into our Bodies, but as it is the Bread of Eternal Life.</p>
                     <p n="69">LXIX. By the Authority of this moſt Learned Father,<note place="margin">He Sums up the force of St. <hi>Ambr.</hi> his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</note> we are taught how vaſt a difference there is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Body, in which Chriſt ſuffered, and the Blood which he ſhed out of his Side, as he hung on the Croſs, and that Body which is daily celebrated by the Faithful, in the Myſtery of his Paſſion; and that
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:66341:116"/>
Blood, which is received with their Mouths, as the Sacrament of that Blood wherewith the whole World was Redeemed. For that Bread and Drink, are not the Body and Blood of Chriſt, as they are vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; but as they Spiritually mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter the Suſtenance of Life. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, that Body, in which Chriſt once ſuffered, appeared to be no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing than really it was; for ſuch it really was as it appeared to the eye, to the touch, the ſame thing which was Crucified and Buried. Likewiſe the Blood iſſuing from his Side, did not outwardly appear one thing, and inwardly contain an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other: So that true Blood flowed from his true Side. But now the Blood of Chriſt, which the Faithful drink, and that Body which they eat, <hi>are one thing in their Nature, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in their Signification;</hi> one thing, as they feed the Body, Bodily Food; and another thing, as they feed the Soul, <hi>viz.</hi> the Suſtenance of Eternal Life.</p>
                     <p n="70">LXX. Of which matter St. <hi>Hierom</hi> in his Comment on St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> writes thus:<note place="margin">St. <hi>Hierom</hi> on the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſ.</hi> c. 1.</note>

Fleſh and Blood of Chriſt is taken in two Senſes; in the one, it's that Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and Divine, of which he ſaith, My Fleſh is Meat indeed, and my Blood is Drink indeed.— In the other, it is that Fleſh which was Crucified, and that Blood which was let out by the Soldier's Spear.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="71">LXXI. This Doctor diſtinguiſhes, and makes no ſmall difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two acceptations of Chriſts Body and Blood.<note place="margin">Chriſt'<hi>s</hi> Body is taken in two Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</note> For whilſt he ſtiles that Body and Blood of Chriſt, Spiritual, which is daily received by the Faithful; and that Fleſh which was Crucified, and that Blood which was let out by the Soldier's Spear, is not ſaid to be either Spiritual, or Divine; he manifeſtly inſinuates, that theſe differ from each other, as much as Corporeal and Spiritual, Viſible and Inviſible, Humane and Divine: Now things that differ, are not the ſame. And in the Opinion of this Author, [<hi>viz.</hi> St. <hi>Hierom</hi>] That Spiritual Fleſh which the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful receive with their Mouths, and that Spiritual Blood, which is daily given to Believers to drink, differ from that Fleſh which was Crucified,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:66341:118"/>
and that Blood which was let out by the Souldier's Spear: Therefore they are not the ſame.</p>
                     <p n="72">LXXII. For that Fleſh which was crucified,<note place="margin">He ſheweth the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of his Natural and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Body.</note> was made of the Virgin's Fleſh, conſiſting of Bones and Nerves, diſtinguiſh'd by its Lineaments, into ſeveral Members of a humane Body, animated with a reaſonable Soul, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving proper Life, and agreeable Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. But that Spiritual Body, which ſpiritually feeds the faithful People, as to its external Nature, is made of ſeveral Grains of Wheat, by the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker's hand, hath neither Sinews nor Bones, nor diſtinction of Members, nor is it animated by any reaſonable Subſtance, nor can it exerciſe any vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Motion. But that, whatever it is which gives the Subſtance of Life, is the Efficacy of a ſpiritual Power, of an inviſible and divine Virtue. And that which appears outwardly, is quite another thing, than that which is believed in the Myſtery. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, the Fleſh of Chriſt which was crucified, did not outwardly appear any other thing, than what inwardly it was. For it was the true Fleſh of a true Man; a true Body in the ſhape of a true Body.</p>
                     <p n="73">
                        <pb n="221" facs="tcp:66341:119"/>LXXIII. It is further to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,<note place="margin">The Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Bread a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of the People, as well as of Chriſt's Body.</note> That in that Bread, not only the Body of Chriſt, but alſo the Body of the People believing in him, is fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured; and therefore it is made of many grains of Wheat, as the Body of faithful People is made up of many Believers by the Word of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="74">LXXIV. For which reaſon, as in the Sacrament, that Bread is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to be Chriſt's Body; ſo in the ſame Sacrament, his Members, the People that believe in Chriſt, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſignified. And as that Bread is ſaid to be the Body of the Faithful, not corporally, but ſpiritually; ſo muſt it neceſſarily be underſtood to be the Body of Chriſt, not corporal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but ſpiritually.<note place="margin">As is alſo the Water mixt with the Wine.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p n="75">LXXV. So with the Wine, which is called Chriſt's Blood,<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Both the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> Church uſed to mix Water with Wine in the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> but held it not eſſential to the Sacrament.</note> Water is commanded to be mixt; nor is one allowed to be offered without the other; becauſe neither is the People without Chriſt, nor Chriſt without the People: As the Head cannot be without the Body, nor the Body with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:66341:120"/>
the Head. Laſtly, Water in that Sacrament, repreſents the People. Now if the Wine conſecrated by the Miniſter's Office, were corporally changed into Chriſt's Blood, the Water alſo which is mixed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, muſt neceſſarily be corporally changed into the Blood of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful People: For where there is but one Conſecration, there is conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently but one Operation; and where there is the like Reaſon, there is the like Myſtery. But we ſee no corporeal Change in the Water, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there any corporeal Change in the Wine. The Repreſentation of the Body of the People in the Water, is altogether ſpiritual; therefore the Repreſentation of the Blood of Chriſt in the Wine, muſt alſo of neceſſity be altogether ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual.</p>
                     <p n="76">LXXVI. Again,<note place="margin">The Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible, therefore not Chriſt's natural Body.</note> Things that differ from each other, are not the ſame. The Body of Chriſt that died, and roſe again, and being made immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,<note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 6.6.</note> 
                        <hi>dieth no more, nor hath Death any more Dominion over it;</hi> is eternal now, and no longer paſſible. But that which is celebrated in the Church, is temporal, not eternal;
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:66341:121"/>
corruptible, not exempt from Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption; in our Way, not in our <hi>[heavenly]</hi> Country. Therefore they differ, and are not the ſame. And if they are not the ſame, how are they ſaid to be the <hi>true Body,</hi> and <hi>true Blood</hi> of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>LXXVII. For if it be Chriſt's Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, if it be truly ſaid, that it is Chriſt's Body, then it is Chriſt's Body in verity [of Nature;] and if ſo, then it is incorruptible, impaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and by conſequence, eternal. And therefore this Body of Chriſt, which is celebrated in the Church, muſt neceſſarily be incorruptible and eternal. Now it cannot be denied, but that thing is corrupted which is broken into pieces, and diſtributed piece-meal to be received, and being ground by the Teeth, paſſeth into the Body. But it is one thing, that is outwardly done, and another that is received by Faith. That which our bodily Senſe perceives, is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible; that which Faith believes, is incorruptible. Wherefore that which outwardly appears, is not the thing it ſelf, but the Image of it; but that which the Mind perceives and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands, is the very thing it ſelf.</p>

                     <p n="81">LXXXI. And after many other Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, he adds, <q>

                     <p n="82">LXXXII. By the Authority of this Doctor, treating on the Words of our Lord, touching the Sacrament of his own Body and Blood, we are plainly taught, That thoſe words of our Lord are to be ſpiritually, and not carnally underſtood; as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſaith; <hi>The words which I ſpeak un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, are Spirit and Life.</hi> That is, his Words concerning eating his Fleſh, &amp; drinking his Blood.

                     <p n="83">LXXXIII. So then we ſee, that food of the Lord's Body, &amp; that drink of
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:66341:126"/>
his blood, are in ſome reſpect truly his Body and his Blood; that is, in the ſame reſpect in which they are Spirit and Life.</p>
                     <p n="84">LXXXIV. Again, thoſe things which are one and the ſame are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended under the ſame Definition. We ſay of the true Body of Chriſt, that he is very God, and very Man; God, begotten of God the Father be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the World began; and Man born of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> in the end of the World. But ſince theſe things cannot be ſaid of the Body of Chriſt, which is myſtically celebrated in the Church, we know that it is only in ſome particular manner the Body of Chriſt; which manner is Figurative, and in the way of an Image; ſo that the Verity is the Thing it ſelf.</p>
                     <p n="85">LXXXV.<note place="margin">He argues from a Prayer in his time uſed after the H.

                     <p n="86">LXXXVI. A Pledge and Image are the Pledge and Image of ſomewhat elſe; that is, they do not reſpect themſelves, but another thing. It is the Pledge of that thing for which it is given, the Image of the thing it repreſents.

                     <p n="87">LXXXVII. Wherefore it is indeed the Body and Blood of Chriſt which the Church celebrates; but in the way
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:66341:128"/>
of a Pledge, or an Image: The truth we ſhall then have, when the Pledge or Image ſhall ceaſe, and the very thing it ſelf ſhall appear.</p>
                     <p n="88">LXXXVIII. And in another Prayer;<note place="margin">He argues from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Collect.</note>
                        <note n="(a)" place="bottom">This is extant in the ordinary Maſs-Book.</note> 
                        <hi>Let thy Sacrament work in us, O Lord, we beſeech thee, thoſe things which they contain, that we may really be made partakers of thoſe things which now we celebrate in a figure.</hi> He ſaith that theſe things are celebrated in a Figure, not in Truth; that is, by way of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation, and not the<note n="(b)" place="bottom">Or Real Preſence.</note> Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of the Thing it ſelf. Now the Figure and the Truth are very different things: Therefore that Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Blood of Chriſt which is cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated in the Church, differs from the Body and Blood of Chriſt, which is glorified. That Body is the Pledge or Figure, but this the very Truth it ſelf; the former we celebrate, till we come to the latter; and when we come to the latter, the former ſhall be done way.</p>

It is apparent therefore, that they differ vaſtly, as much as the Pledge, and that whereof it is the Pledge; as much as the Image, and the Thing whoſe Image it is, as much as the Figure and Truth. We ſee then how vaſt a difference there is between the Myſtery of Chriſt's Body and Blood, which the Faithful now receive in the Church, and that Body which was born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> which ſuffered, was buried, roſe again, aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into Heaven, and ſitteth at the Right-hand of God. For that Body which is celebrated here in our way, muſt be ſpiritually received; for Faith believes ſomewhat that it ſeeth not; and it ſpiritually feeds the Soul, makes glad the Heart, and confers Eternal Life and Incorruption, if we attend not to that which feeds the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which is chewed with our Teeth, and ground to pieces, but to that which is ſpiritually received by Faith. Now that Body in which Chriſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, and roſe again, was his own proper Body which he aſſumed of the Virgin, which might be ſeen and felt after his Reſurrection; as he ſaith to his Diſciples; <hi>Luke</hi> 24.40. <hi>Handle me,

That which you ſee, is Bread and the Cup; thus much your own Eyes inform you: But that wherein your Faith needs Inſtruction, is, that this Bread is the Body of Chriſt, and the Cup is the Blood of Chriſt.

you believe, you will not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand. <hi>You may be apt to ſay to me, You require us to believe, expound to us, that we may underſtand. Such a Thought as this may ariſe in any man's Heart. We know that our Lord Jeſus Chriſt took Fleſh of the Virgin</hi> Mary; <hi>when an Infant, he was ſuckled, nouriſhed, grew, and arrived to the Age of a young Man, was Perſecuted by the</hi> Jews, <hi>ſuffered, was hanged on a Tree, put to Death, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken down, and buried, the third day he roſe again, and on that day himſelf pleaſed, he aſcended the Heavens, and carried up his Body thither, and ſhall from thence come to Judge both quick and dead, where he is now ſitting at the right Hand of the Father. How is Bread his Body, and how is the Cup, or the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor in the Cup, his Blood? Theſe, my Brethren, are ſtiled Sacraments, becauſe in them we ſee one thing, and underſtand another.

                  <p>ABout Three Months after I had firſt Publiſh'd this ſmall Tract, I was acquainted by a Friend that it was newly Printed at <hi>Paris,</hi> with a quite contrary deſign, <hi>viz.</hi> To ſhew there the Sentiments of <hi>Ratram,</hi> touching the Sacrament of the Euchariſt were exactly conformable to the Faith of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. This News made me very deſirous to ſee the Book, but living near an Hundred Miles from <hi>London,</hi> it was above ſix Months more, ere I could procure
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:66341:142"/>
it. At firſt view I perceived the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſher<note n="(a)" place="bottom">
                        <hi>James Boileau,</hi> Doctor in Divinity of the College of <hi>Sorbon,</hi> and Dean of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitan Church of <hi>Sens.</hi>
                     </note> was a Perſon of no ſmall Figure in the <hi>French</hi> Church; and that he had ſeveral other Doctors of the <hi>Sorbon</hi> to avouch,<note n="(b)" place="bottom">See the Approbation at the end.</note> 
                     <hi>That there is nothing either in his Verſion or Notes, but what is agreeable to the Text of that Ancient Writer.</hi> But upon further peruſal I ſoon found that <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur Boileau,</hi> had rather given us his own Paraphraſe, than the Author's Words in <hi>French;</hi> that his deſign was not ſo much a Tranſlation, as the Converſion of <hi>Bertram;</hi> and that he had made almoſt as great and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful a change in his Doctrine, as that which the Romaniſts pretend to be wrought in the Euchariſt it ſelf. I confeſſ his Undertaking ſeemed both uſeful and ſeaſonable, and well deſerving encouragement; for if he proceed ſucceſsful in it (in the preſent juncture) it muſt needs much facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the Converſions in hand. And unleſs ſome ſuch way can be found out to bring over the <hi>Old</hi> Hereticks,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:66341:142"/>
who for a Thouſand Years together after CHRIST, taught that <hi>The Bread and Wine remain after Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> and that, <hi>It is not the Natural Body of our Saviour, which is orally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the Holy Sacrament.</hi> The poor Hugonots will ſtill be of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>That they ought not to distruſt the Judgment of their Senſes, confirmed by Scripture and Antiquity, or to reſign their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderstandings to any Church Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority on Earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the miſery of it is, that the Doctor hath not been more generous in his Undertaking, than he is unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate in his performance: For tho' the Abjurations of the new Converts, cannot be more againſt their private Senſe, than Dr. <hi>Boileau</hi>'s Expoſition is againſt the Senſe of this Author; yet as they recant their forced Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions, whenever they can eſcape out of <hi>France;</hi> ſo <hi>Bertram</hi> when per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to ſpeak his own Words in <hi>Latine,</hi> contradicts whatever this Tranſlator hath forced him againſt his mind to ſay in <hi>French.</hi> But how ill ſoever he hath treated the Author in French, we muſt acknowledg our ſelves very much obliged to him, for
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:66341:143"/>
giving us the <hi>Latin</hi> Text,<note n="(c)" place="bottom">See his Preface, p. 18.</note> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>F. Mabillons</hi> correct Copy of the <hi>Lobes</hi> Manuſcript. We thank him heartily for it, and it is no ſmall piece of Juſtice he hath done us, to ſhew the World that the former Printed Copies were not corrupted by us, as ſome have pretended. That the Variations from them are incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, generally in the order of the Syntax, or the uſe of ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther word of like ſignification; and where the Doctor himſelf thinks the variations material, the advantage (if any be) lies on our ſide.</p>
                  <p>In his Preface and Remarks, I meet with nothing of any moment, which is not obviated, and fully cleared in my<note n="(d)" place="bottom">In Chapters IV. and V.</note> Diſſertation. For I had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered the main things on which he inſiſts, in the Writings of <hi>F. Mabillon,</hi> and <hi>Natalis Alexander,</hi> and given them an Anſwer. If he had borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>F. Mabillon</hi>'s Modeſty and Ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as he hath done his Arguments, or contented himſelf with them, he would have eſcaped many foul impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, which will now unavoidably
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:66341:143"/>
diſparage either his <hi>Judgment,</hi> or his <hi>Integrity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are two things which diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble me for a thorough examination of Monſieur <hi>Boileau</hi>'s Work; the one is the want<note n="*" place="bottom">Dacherij Spicilegium. <hi>Mabillonij</hi> Anale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta, &amp;c.</note> of ſome Books, which it were neceſſary for me to conſult on this occaſion, which cannot be here procured; and the other, the want of a little more critical Skill in the <hi>French,</hi> in order to the more effectual diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of his unfair dealing. However under theſe diſavantages, I doubt not to convince all unprejudiced Perſons, of theſe three things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Firſt, That Monſieur <hi>Boileau</hi> hath groſly miſrepreſented the deſign and ſentiments of <hi>Ratram,</hi> in this Book.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That he hath not acted the part of a Faithful Tranſlator, nor uſed that exactneſs which himſelf, and his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provers pretend, but on the contrary hath all along accommodated his Verſion to his own Hypotheſis, and not the Authors Words.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That his Expoſition of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted Terms in this Diſcourſe,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:66341:144"/>
both in his Preface and Remarks is often very abſurd, that thoſe Terms cannot bear his Senſe, nor are they uſed therein by other Eccleſiaſtical Writers, either of the ſame or elder times.</p>
                  <p>And the proof of theſe, will be a full confutation of this Doctors con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident Pretence, that this Book of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tram contains no other Sentiments, than thoſe of that Church,</hi> which he ſtiles, <hi>Catholick, Apoſtolick and Roman, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Sacrament of the Euchariſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Before I enter upon the firſt part of my Undertaking, it will not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs to take a ſhort view of Monſieur <hi>Boileau</hi>'s Preface, the ſum of which is this.</p>

                     <q>That although this piece of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tram</hi> is one of the moſt conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Monuments of the Ninth Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, and ſerves admirably to clear the perpetuity of the Faith touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Euchariſt, yet it hath lain in the dark, and been taken notice of, by almoſt no body, from his own time till it was Printed at <hi>Colen, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no Dom.</hi> 1532. That upon its firſt appearance in publick, it met with very odd entertainment, and quite contrary to what it deſerved; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:66341:144"/>
challenged by the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> as favourable to their Sentiments, and given up by the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> as an Impudent and Heretical Forge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Inſomuch, that this Tract was put into the <hi>Index</hi> of Prohibited Books made in the Council of <hi>Trent, Anno Dom.</hi> 1559. and ſtands con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in the ſucceeding <hi>Indices,</hi> and the moſt eminent Doctors of that Communion have ever ſince e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed it a Dangerous and Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Piece. Some few indeed have treated poor <hi>Ratram</hi> a little more favourably. The <hi>Lovain</hi> Divines, who compiled the <hi>Belgick Index,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that with the help of a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Expoſition, he may be tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And <hi>M. de Sainte Boeuve,</hi> Kings Profeſſor of Divinity in the <hi>Sorbon,</hi> did in the Year 1655. generouſly undertake the Defence of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine in his publick Lectures. But after all, no leſs a man than <hi>Petrus de Marca</hi> and others, have been ſince labouring to prove, that this Book was written by <hi>Joannes Scotus,</hi> and not <hi>Ratram,</hi> and is the ſame that was condemned in the <hi>Berenga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> Controverſie by the Synods of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Vercelli.</hi> Having rejected
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:66341:145"/>
this, and all other hard cenſures, he tells us that <hi>Ratram's</hi> Sentiments are entirely Catholick, and not in the leaſt contrary to the Doctrine of <hi>Paſchaſius Radbertus,</hi> or the preſent Roman Church; and this he doubts not to make evident, by his Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation of <hi>Bertram</hi> into French, and the Expoſition of his obſcure terms given in this Preface, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks which he hath added to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his Tranſlation.</q>

                  <p>This is more than enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute all that M. <hi>Boileau</hi> offers to prove,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:66341:158"/>
that <hi>Ratram</hi>'s Adverſaries believed <hi>no Figure in the Holy Sacrament.</hi> Let us next ſee how he proves, that the Opinion encountred by him in the Second part of this Tract, was not the Opinion of <hi>Paſchaſe,</hi> but of ſome body (he knows not who) that held the <hi>Senſible part of the Holy Euchariſt,</hi> or the Accidents of Bread and Wine, <hi>to be the ſame Body which was Born of the Virgin,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Truly, for the Proof hereof, he miſrepreſents the Subject of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, as though it were only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>the Senſible Qualities of what is received</hi> in the Holy Sacrament; whereas it is touching <hi>the Thing orally received:</hi> Then he refers us to his Tranſlation and Remarks, which we ſhall conſider in their proper place. And in the beginning of his Preface, he ſets aſide the Teſtimony of <hi>Cellot</hi>'s Anonymus, who tells us, That <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tram</hi> and <hi>Rabanus,</hi> both oppoſed <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe</hi> in this Point, tho' the Truth of what he aſſerts be notorious, from the expreſs Words of both thoſe Writers.

                  <p n="3">III. My third Reaſon to ſhew that Mr. <hi>Boileau</hi> hath not given us a true account of the Sentiments and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of <hi>Ratram,</hi> is becauſe his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments prove a great deal more, than that there is a Figure in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or that the Accidents are not the Senſible Truth of Chriſt's Body.</p>
                  <p>The very firſt Inference he makes is this,<note n="(d)" place="bottom">Claret quia Panis ille Vinumque FI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GURATE Chriſti Corpus &amp; Sanguis EXISTIT. n. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>Hence it is evident, that this Bread and Wine are Figuratively Chriſt's Body and Blood;</hi> which is a great deal more than that there is a Figure in the Sacrament. 1.

                     <pb n="346" facs="tcp:66341:177"/>Again, When he hath proved that there is no <hi>Phyſical</hi> change upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration, neither Generation, nor Corruption nor Alteration, he thence infers<note n="(e)" place="bottom">Neceſſe eſt jam ut FIGURATE facta eſſe dicatur, ſcil. commutatio. n. 16.</note> that of neceſſity it muſt be <hi>Figuratively</hi> changed, which is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more than Mr. <hi>Boileau</hi> will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge to have been in diſpute between him and his Adverſaries. For it determines the Nature of the change to be <hi>Figurative,</hi> and if ſo, the Elements are not <hi>Subſtantially</hi> turned into Chriſt's Body and Blood, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath defined.

                  <p>Mr. <hi>Boileau</hi> hopes to excuſe him from aſſerting in the forementioned Expreſſion, that which he takes to be the Doctrine of <hi>Berengarius,</hi> and the Reformed Churches by this ſhift: Saith he, <q>

                  </p>
                  <p>But all this is meer Smoak, and Amuſement.

                  <p>
                     <pb n="353" facs="tcp:66341:180"/>The ſame Inference may be alſo made from <hi>Ratram</hi>'s Parallel of the Holy Euchariſt with Manna, and the Rock Water, which he ſaith were <hi>Spiritually turned</hi> into Chriſt's Body and Blood, and were eaten and drunk by the Faithful <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the Wilderneſs. His ſcope is plainly this, to prove that the change made by Conſecration is not Subſtantial, but Figurative, like that of the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, which could not be properly Tranſubſtantiated into Chriſt's Body, before his Incarnation, before he had a Body prepared him.</p>
                  <p>And yet a wanton Wit might in Mr. <hi>Boileau</hi>'s way, as handſomely elude all Arguments againſt <hi>Ratram's</hi> belief of a ſubſtantial change of the Manna and Water into Chriſt's Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as he doth our Arguments againſt the Corporal Preſence <hi>from Bertram.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If he object that <hi>Bertram</hi> ſpeaks of the ſubſtance of Manna and tne Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it is eaſily anſwered, that the word <hi>Subſtantia,</hi> even by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Mr. <hi>Boileau</hi>

largely, for the Senſible Qualities of things.</p>
                  <p>If he urge that <hi>Bertram</hi> calls them Corporal Things, it may be anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that by<note n="(p)" place="bottom">Remarques, p. 222.</note> Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s confeſſion, that may ſignifie no more than the External appearance of a Body, and the ſenſible Accidents.</p>
                  <p>If he further preſs the Impoſſibility of the Thing, that Manna ſhould be ſubſtantially converted into a body not Exiſting: It may be plauſibly repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That <hi>Bertram</hi> ſaith<note n="(q)" place="bottom">N. 25.</note>, <hi>We muſt not exerciſe our Reaſon, but our Faith in this matter.</hi> It is a Miracle, a Myſtery Incomprehenſible, a Work of God's Omnipotence, which is not to be limited by the pretence of Impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and Abſurdities.</p>
                  <p>In fine, when he comes to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the firſt Queſtion, and make his Inference from all the Arguments and Authorities which he had before alledged, he concludes thus:<note n="(r)" place="bottom">N. 49.

                  <p>From which Paſſage it is plain, not only that <hi>Ratram</hi> proves a Figure in the Sacrament, but that this Figure is more than the outward appearance of Bread and Wine, that it is the Subſtance, for what he meant by the viſible Species he after explains, by calling them the<note n="(ſ)" place="bottom">Viſibilis Species <hi>is Expounded by</hi> Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibilis Creatura.</note> Viſible Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and affirming that it feeds the Body; and though he oppoſe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the Inviſible Subſtance, the words that follow direct us to take <hi>Subſtance</hi> in an improper ſenſe.</p>

                  <p>In the ſecond Part, it is as evident that he encounters not that Fictiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Error Mr. <hi>Boileau</hi> would have him, <hi>viz.</hi> That the outward Species, and Senſible Accidents of Bread and Wine, are Chriſt's Fleſh and Blood born of the Virgin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For firſt, The ſubject of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is, as hath been already ſhewn, the <hi>Conſecrated Elements,</hi> the <hi>whole Euchariſt as Orally received,</hi> and not their meer Accidents: <hi>For</hi> he ſaith,

For the meer Accidents are in no ſenſe Chriſt's Natural Body, <hi>they are in no way</hi> Chriſts Body in verity of Nature, neither the <hi>Senſible</hi> nor yet the <hi>Inviſible</hi> verity thereof.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The matter in Queſtion cannot be whether the Holy Euchariſt is Chriſts Body born of the Virgin, in its proper ſtate, with its Senſible Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, and Dimenſions, but whether it be his True and Natural Body, which <hi>Paſchaſe</hi> deſcribes as in the Queſtion.</p>
                  <p>The former could not be the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion oppoſed by our Author, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:66341:183"/>
that he no where mentions any ſuch Opinion, it doth not any way elſe appear by any Writer, either before or of his time, that ſuch an Opinion was ever embraced, or ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by any Man.</p>
                  <p>The latter was the Doctrine of <hi>Paſchaſe,</hi> a Doctrine which by his own confeſſion gave offence to many, and that <hi>Ratram</hi> diſputes againſt it, ſeems very clear to any Man who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth, in how accurate Terms he eſtabliſheth an Eſſential Difference, between the Conſecrated Elements and Chriſts Natural Body.</p>
                  <p>He diſtinguiſheth them as things of vaſtly different Natures, uſing the words <hi>aliud</hi> and <hi>aliud,</hi> ONE THING and ANOTHER THING, THIS Body, and THAT Body, which was born of the Virgin.

That Chriſts Natural Body and Blood are THINGS, but the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries hereof are SACRAMENTS. <hi>Num.</hi> 36.</p>
                  <p>Again, He proves them to differ (I think Eſſentially) becauſe the ſame Definition doth not agree to

neither are thoſe Terms ſo uſed by Eccleſiaſtical Writers of the ſame or elder Times.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall begin with the word <hi>Veritas,</hi> which is one of the Terms of the firſt Queſtion, and often occurs in this Tract. Now when <hi>Ratram</hi> denieth that which is <hi>orally received</hi> in the Sacrament, to be Chriſt's Body and Blood in <hi>Verity,</hi> or his <hi>True</hi> Body and Blood, we underſtand him to deny the Holy Euchariſt to be his Body and Blood in <hi>Reality</hi> or <hi>Truth of Nature,</hi> or which is all one, his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Body.

                  </p>
                  <p>Now on this Point we will joyn Iſſue, and I will firſt examine the Proofs he brings for his ſenſe of the word, and afterwards I ſhall ſhew that ſenſe to be falſe, abſurd, and contrary to the uſe of that Term in other Eccleſiaſtical Writers of the ſame and elder Times.</p>
                  <p>To make out his Notion of the Word, two things are offer'd by <hi>M. Boileau.</hi> 1. He ſaith, That <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tram</hi> himſelf expounds <hi>Verity</hi> by <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation.</hi> 2. That the Writers of the middle Ages uſe it to ſignifie the
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:66341:203"/>
                     <hi>Depoſitions of Witneſſes, and the Proof</hi> of things.</p>
                  <p>To the former of theſe, ſomewhat hath already been ſaid in the<note n="(y)" place="bottom">Pag. 66.</note> Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertation before this Tract, and in this Appendix, which I deſire the Reader to conſult, and I ſhall further add what I conceive will take off the force of this Argument.</p>
                  <p>I admit that <hi>Ratram</hi> doth ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound <hi>Verity,</hi> and defines it to be the <hi>manifest Demonſtration</hi> of a <hi>thing,</hi> but he no where expounds <hi>Manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to be the <hi>Senſible Appearance.</hi> I have already ſhewn that the <hi>Verity</hi> which he defines is <hi>Propriety</hi> and <hi>Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Speech</hi> in oppoſition to <hi>Figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative Speech;</hi> and in that Notion of this word, divers things are <hi>manifeſted</hi> which have no Senſible Appearances. Theſe ſayings, that <hi>the Father is God, the Soul is a Spirit,</hi> that <hi>Angels are Creatures,</hi> are in <hi>Ratram</hi>'s ſenſe, the <hi>naked Manifeſtation</hi> of the <hi>Truth,</hi> or the <hi>plain</hi> or <hi>manifest Demonſtration</hi> of the things, which have no <hi>Senſible Appearance</hi> at all; that is, the words in their <hi>native</hi> ſignification import
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:66341:204"/>
that which they are uſed to expreſs; whereas in the Figurative and My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Forms of Speech, the words are uſed to expreſs quite another thing, than what they <hi>really</hi> and <hi>naturally</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. So that the one is a covert and obſcure, the other a plain, proper and natural way of ſpeaking, and this <hi>Bertram</hi> calls <hi>the clear light of Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation, the plain or ſimple Verity;</hi> and our <hi>Saxon</hi> Homiliſt, as I have ſhewn, uſeth a word<note n="(z)" place="bottom">geƿissum ðing <hi>Fol</hi> 29.</note> of the ſame importance; whereas had he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood <hi>Bertram</hi> in that ſenſe <hi>M. Boileau</hi> doth, he muſt have expreſſed <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation</hi> by another word, which is afterwards uſed for the<note n="(a)" place="bottom">sume sƿutelunge be ðam hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan husel, <hi>Fol.</hi> 38.</note> 
                     <hi>Senſible Demonstration</hi> of a thing.</p>
                  <p>Now as this Term, when applied to Forms of Speech, imports <hi>Propriety</hi> of <hi>Speech,</hi> ſo when applied to Things, it ſignifieth <hi>Propriety</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> or the <hi>Very thing</hi> it ſelf, without any Myſtical Signification of, or Reſpect unto <hi>another thing.</hi> And thus it ſtands oppoſed to a <hi>Pledg,</hi> an <hi>Image,</hi> or
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:66341:204"/>
Figure inſtituted to <hi>repreſent</hi> one thing, whilſt it is in <hi>Substance,</hi> in <hi>Reality</hi> and <hi>Truth of Nature</hi> another.</p>
                  <p>When its urged to prove that <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tram</hi> uſeth the word <hi>Manifestation</hi> to ſignifie the <hi>Reality,</hi> That he muſt uſe it in the ſame ſenſe it was uſed by his Adverſaries, who muſt either thereby underſtand, the <hi>Reality;</hi> or elſe believe the Holy Euchariſt to be our Saviour's Body, <hi>in humane Form,</hi> which none pretends they did: Mr. <hi>Dean</hi> briskly denies the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and like a Doctor of great Authority, adds,<note n="(b)" place="bottom">
                        <hi>P. 35.</hi> Je Soutiens, qu'ils ſe perſuadoient ſeulement de voir le Corps &amp; le Sang'de J. C. af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectez des qualitez du pain &amp; vin, &amp;c.</note>

                  <p>Now I appeal to any Man of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe, whether any thing can be more abſurd, than ſome Paſſages of this Book are, if ſo expounded? For Example, in that Prayer,<note n="(c)" place="bottom">

<pb n="402" facs="tcp:66341:205"/>
which is received in a <hi>Sacramental Image,</hi> the meaning muſt be, that they might partake of our Saviour's Fleſh, under the Senſible Appearance of Bread. And again, where<note n="(d)" place="bottom">
                        <hi>N. 97.</hi> Nec in eo vel aliqua figura vel ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificatio ſed ipſa rei Manifeſtatio.</note> he ſaith, the Body which ſuffer'd and roſe again, is our Saviour's Proper Body, and in it there is no Figure or Signification, but the <hi>Manifestation</hi> of the thing it ſelf, he muſt mean, if <hi>M. Boileau</hi> hath hit upon the true Notion of <hi>Ratram</hi>'s Adverſaries, that the Body of our Saviour which was crucified and roſe again, is his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Body affected with the ſenſible Accidents of Bread, which I take to be rank Nonſenſe, and ſo I am apt to think doth our Tranſlator alſo: For he doth not render that Paſſage by the word <hi>Manifestation,</hi> as he had elſewhere done, leaving the Reader to ſeek the ſenſe of ſo uncouth a Phraſe in his Preface and Remarks, but he renders it by words importing our <hi>Saviours Body in Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Shape.</hi> Though in ſo doing he makes <hi>Bertram</hi> a very deſpicable and
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:66341:205"/>
impertinent Sophiſter, and to diſpute vehemently againſt an Opinion which his Adverſaries did not maintain. For ſo he doth, if they affirming the Holy Euchariſt to be Chriſt's Body affected with the Senſible Appearances of Bread, he brings Arguments to prove that it was not his Body <hi>in its proper ſtate,</hi> that is, retaining the <hi>Members, Dimenſions, Lineaments, and all other Senſible Qualities</hi> of a Man's Body.</p>
                  <p>That <hi>Ratram</hi> uſed <hi>Manifeſtation</hi> as a Term equivalent to the <hi>Reality,</hi> is clear to any Man who will obſerve how he uſeth the Adverb <hi>Manifeſte,</hi> which is one of its Conjugates. When he is deſcribing a Pledge and Image, he ſaith,<note n="(e)" place="bottom">Significant enim ista rem, cujus ſunt, non manifeſte oſtendunt. <hi>N. 86.</hi>
                     </note> they have a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to ſome other thing which they ſignifie, but <hi>non manifeſte oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dunt</hi> do not manifeſtly ſhew, <hi>i.e.</hi> really exhibit. This muſt be his ſenſe, for he he is delivering the Notion of Pledges and Images in General which are not the very thing for which they are depoſited, or which they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:66341:206"/>
in <hi>Subſtance</hi> and <hi>Reality,</hi> and only want the Senſible Appearances there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. For on the contrary, an <hi>Image</hi> hath the <hi>Senſible Appearance</hi> of what it repreſents without the <hi>Reality.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I do not deny but <hi>Ratram</hi> ſuppoſes Chriſt's true Body to be Viſible, when he ſaith, it is the very Manifeſtation of the thing; ſome of his Arguments to prove the Sacrament not to be Chriſt's Very Body, are drawn from a Suppoſition, that if it were ſo, it would be a Living, Organical Body, Viſible, Palpable and Manifeſt to our Bodily Senſes: Yet the <hi>Viſibility</hi> of Chriſts glorified Body, is not the thing primarily imported by the word <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation,</hi> but its Truth and Reality. As the Apoſtle, ſpeaking of<note n="(f)" place="bottom">1 Tim. 3.16.</note> God manifeſt in the fleſh, principally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd to teach the <hi>Truth of Christ's Incarnation,</hi> that the Word was <hi>truly</hi> made Fleſh, that is, Man, and not that God Viſibly appear'd to Man. And as<note n="(g)" place="bottom">Idem ipſe Chriſtus illis in Petra <hi>figuratus,</hi> nobis in carne manifeſtatus eſt. <hi>Aug. in Pſal. 77.</hi>

calleth our Lord's <hi>True</hi> or <hi>Very</hi> Body, and denieth the Holy Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt to be that Body. For Inſtance, he ſaith that Chriſt's Natural Body<note n="(o)" place="bottom">Non ſit Myſterium ſed Veritas Naturae. <hi>N. 57</hi>

IT SELF, in the Preface of this Tract; and all theſe Expreſſions plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly import the REALITY.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, He calls our Saviour's Body, born of the Virgin<note n="(y)" place="bottom">Illud namque <hi>proprium</hi> &amp; <hi>Verum</hi> nihil habens in ſe vel Myſticum vel Figuratum: hoc vero Myſticum.</note>, his Proper and True Body, having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <hi>Myſtical</hi> or <hi>Figurative</hi> in it. So many ſeveral ways is the Term <hi>Verity</hi> explained, and in all the Holy Euchariſt denied to be the True, that is, REAL Body of our Saviour.</p>
                  <p>Again, The Senſe of the word <hi>Verity,</hi> may be learned from the Terms to which it ſtands oppoſed through the whole Diſcourſe, which manifeſtly declare the ſubject of which they are affirmed, not to be Chriſts <hi>Real</hi> Body. Sometimes it is oppoſed to a <hi>Figure,</hi> now nothing is a Sign or Figure of it ſelf, ſometime to a <hi>Pledge,</hi> ſometime to an <hi>Image,</hi> to a <hi>Similitude,</hi> a <hi>Remembrance,</hi> and the like; and by affirming the Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Elements to be Chriſt's Body in any of the forementioned reſpects, he virtually denieth them to be his Natural and <hi>Real</hi> Body, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:66341:211"/>
when he ſaith they are Chriſt's Fleſh and Blood <hi>in Figure</hi> and not <hi>in Truth,</hi> he muſt mean thereby, <hi>not in Reality.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, If this be not the Senſe of that Term, <hi>Ratram</hi>'s Reaſoning, <hi>N.</hi> 77. is falſe and abſurd<note n="(z)" place="bottom">Si enim— hoc vere dicitur quia Corpus Chriſti eſt, <hi>(1)</hi> In Veritate Corpus Chriſti eſt; &amp; ſi in Veritate Corpus Chriſti eſt', — <hi>(2)</hi> Incorruptibile eſt &amp; impaſſibile, <hi>&amp;c. n. 77.</hi>
                     </note>. He argues thus; If the Holy Euchariſt be Chriſts Body, and be <hi>truly</hi> and properly ſaid to be the Body of Chriſt, then it is ſuch in Verity, and if ſo, then it is Incorruptible impaſſible, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence Eternal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now as M. <hi>Boileau</hi> expounds that Term, the former (1) conſequence is falſe, and <hi>Ratram</hi> muſt contradict himſelf as our Adverſaries underſtand him. It followeth not, that if the Euchariſt be <hi>properly and truly ſaid</hi> to be Chriſts Body, that therefore it is ſo in the <hi>ſenſible appearance,</hi> on the Principles of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Nor is the latter (2) Inference valid, <hi>viz.</hi> That if it be Chriſts Body in <hi>ſenſible</hi> Verity, then it is incorruptible and impaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. For the Incorruptibility of
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:66341:211"/>
Chriſts Body, depends not upon the Senſible Qualities, but upon its Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied State. And Chriſt hath no other Real Body but his Glorified Body. In the ſtate of Humiliation, when he was Scourged, Buffeted, and Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, the Body of our Saviour was viſible and palpable, and was a <hi>true</hi> Body with all the ſenſible Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances of ſuch a Body, yet I am of opinion, that M. <hi>Boileau</hi> will ſcarce adventure to ſay, that our Saviour's Body was then Impaſſible, Incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible, or Immortal.</p>
                  <p>Whereas if the word <hi>Veritas</hi> be taken in its genuine and common Senſe, the Conſequence is undeniable. For to the Truth of a Propoſition it is requiſite, that the Praedicate do <hi>really</hi> agree to the Subject, and that the Subject be in <hi>Truth of Nature,</hi> what it is affirmed to be. And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Subject is not <hi>in Reality,</hi> that is either <hi>falſly</hi> or <hi>improperly</hi> affirmed of it.</p>
                  <p>I hope this may ſuffice to ſhew, that <hi>Ratram</hi> did not uſe the Term in M. <hi>Boileau</hi>'s ſenſe, which is as much as I am obliged to prove. But for the further manifeſtation of his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagance in impoſing that ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:66341:212"/>
upon it, I ſhall proceed to let you ſee how contrary it is to the uſage of the word <hi>Verity</hi> in other Eccleſiaſtical Writers of his own and Elder times.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall give you an Inſtance or two out of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who in anſwering thoſe Hereticks, who objected againſt the <hi>Reality</hi> of the Incarnation the words of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. viii. 3. <hi>God ſending his Son in the LIKENESS of ſinful Fleſh,</hi> &amp;c. thus expreſſeth himſelf:<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Non quod Similitudinem Carnis acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perit, quaſi <hi>IMAGINEM</hi> Corporis &amp; non <hi>VERITATEM:</hi> Sed Similitudinem <hi>peccatricis</hi> carnis vult intelligi, &amp;c. <hi>Tertul. de Carne Chriſti,</hi> c. 16.</note> Not that he aſſumed the LIKENESS of FLESH, as if it were the IMAGE of a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and not the VERITY, <hi>i. e.</hi> a Real Body. Again, Anſwering an Objection of <hi>Marcion,</hi> who ſaid, That if the Image of God, the Soul ſinned in Man, the Guilt would af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect God himſelf. He ſaith,<note n="(b)" place="bottom">Porro IMAGO VERITATI haud uſque quaque adaequabitur, aliud enim eſt ſecundum VERITATEM eſſe, aliud IPSAM VERITATEM eſſe, <hi>Adv. Marcion. l. 2. c. 9.</hi>
                     </note> The IMAGE muſt not be in all reſpects
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:66341:212"/>
made equal with the VERITY, it is one thing to be made after the TRUTH, <hi>i. e.</hi> in imitation of it; and another thing to be the VERY TRUTH it ſelf. Again, He proves that Chriſt had a Real Body, becauſe the Sacrament was a Figure of it. For there could be no Figure, unleſs there were a TRUE Body.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Irenaeus</hi> doth not only uſe the word in the ſame ſenſe, but eſtabliſheth an Eſſential difference between the Image, and Verity:<note n="(c)" place="bottom">Typus enim &amp; Imago <hi>ſecundum materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am, &amp; ſecundum Subſtantiam</hi> aliquories a VE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RITATE diverſus eſt, ſecundum autem habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum &amp; lineamentum debet ſervare ſimilitudinem, <hi>Iren. adv.

                     <hi>Aenigmatical vails;</hi> ſo that the former Antitheſis imports a denial that the Viſible Object is the TRUE Body of Chriſt.

                  <p>I have been the more prolix on this Term, becauſe <hi>M. Boileau</hi> layeth the ſtreſs of the whole Controverſie upon its true Senſe, in which I perſuade my ſelf that any impartial Reader muſt needs perceive him to have been groſly miſled by Prejudice.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall now proceed to ſhew how groſs an Errour he is guilty of in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding another Term of no leſs moment in this Controverſie, which is the word SPECIES, which he makes to ſignifie the<note n="(b)" place="bottom">Il ſignifie <hi>apparence,</hi> &amp; non pas la Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance &amp; la Nature des choſes, comme les Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phes le prennent ordinairement.

                  <p>Let us then, before we offer any thing to evince the contrary, ſee
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:66341:218"/>
what Proof <hi>M.

                  <p>The former of the two places to which he refers, is a Remark on theſe words.<note n="(c)" place="bottom">Rem. p. <hi>220.</hi> on n. <hi>xii:</hi> Quoniam ſecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum veritatem Species creaturae quae fuerat ante, permanſiſſe cognoſcitur.</note>

                  <p>Now as the word Sacrament is generally acknowledged to be a term borrowed from the <hi>Roman</hi> Military Laws, ſo probably was the word <hi>Species;</hi> and as Corn and Wine and other ſtores for the publick uſe either of the Prince, the City, or Army go by that Name, eſpecially what came in by way of Penſion<note n="(o)" place="bottom">Species praeterea, quae menſis Regiis appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentur,— perquirite, <hi>l. 12.

                  <p>Now this premiſed, I ſhall attempt to ſhew two things 1. That <hi>Species</hi> in <hi>Bertram,</hi> imports the ſame thing,
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:66341:222"/>
which 'its uſed to ſignifie in the firſt<note n="(p)" place="bottom">Beſtias terra juxta <hi>Species</hi> ſuas, Gen. <hi>l. 25.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>To evince the former I ſhall preſent you with ſome paſſages, which will appear very abſur'd, if the word be underſtood in Mr. <hi>Boileau</hi>'s ſenſe. And I ſhall begin with that, on which he himſelf hath beſtowed a Remark.<note n="(q)" place="bottom">Quoniam ſecundum veritatem Species Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turae quae fuerat ante permanſiſſe cognoſcitur, <hi>n. 12.</hi>

                     <hi>For 'its well known that,</hi> the Species <hi>of the Creature, remains in Truth what it was before.</hi> Now if by <hi>Species</hi> we are with Mr. <hi>Boileau,</hi> to underſtand the ſenſible Appearance, theſe abſurdities will follow.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>Ratram</hi> will contradict himſelf, in what he had ſaid in the very Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence next before. <hi>viz.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. Whereas <hi>Ratram</hi> propoſeth a diſtinction conſiſting of three Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, if <hi>Species</hi> import only the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Qualities, the two latter Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers will be Coincident.

Now if in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Paragraph he deſigned only to aſſert, that the ſenſible Qualities remain after Conſecration; I deſire to be informed what other ſenſible qualities the Holy Elements have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides thoſe here mentioned?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is plain that as paſſing from <hi>Non Entity</hi> into being, is a ſubſtantial

Change, ſo the contrary is a ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Change, whereas if <hi>Species</hi> do not import the ſubſtance, inſtead of the univerſally received diſtinction of two ſorts of Subſtantial Mutation, and one Accidental, he makes <hi>Ratram</hi> the Author of a Novel and unknown Diſtinction of two kinds of Accidental Mutation, and one Subſtantial. And I might add, that the Emphatical word <hi>in Truth,</hi> which I take to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie <hi>verity of Nature</hi> muſt ſtand for juſt nothing; whereas the true mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the place is, <q>That the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Bread and Wine remain <hi>in Reality</hi> after Conſecration what they were before.</q>

The Adjective <hi>Viſible</hi> which is ſometimes joyned with Bread, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with <hi>Species,</hi> ſometimes with <hi>Creature, Sacrament, Food,</hi> is by our Tranſlatour ſo rendred as though it did ſignifie <hi>Apparent</hi> in oppoſition to <hi>Real.</hi> The <hi>Viſible Substance</hi> of Bread, is by him made to imply, ſo much of Bread as appears to the Eye, viz. <hi>Figure</hi> and <hi>Colour.</hi> The <hi>Viſible Creature,</hi> and <hi>Viſible Sacrament,</hi> is with him, no more of them than <hi>falls under our Senſes,</hi> viz. the outward Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Thus at length, I have done with his Expoſition of our Author's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted Terms, which if true, Mr. Dean would do well to Publiſh a Gloſſary on purpoſe to aſſiſt the Reader, who by the help of all the Dictionaries yet extant, will never be able to comprehend this Author's ſenſe. But I muſt needs ſay, the difficulties are all Fictions of the Tranſlator, who delights to perplex the moſt plain Expreſſions, and by new and bold Figures, and forced Significations invented to ſerve his deſign, hath offered manifeſt violence to our Author's words, in an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Paſſages of this ſmall Piece. I confeſs he uſeth ſo great Licenſe, and indulgeth his Fancy at ſo extravagant a Rate, that I was almoſt tempted to think, that M. <hi>Boileau</hi> the Poet, had commenced Doctor in the <hi>Sorbon,</hi> and began unluckily to play the Divine, as Poets commonly do, when they begin their Theological Studies in
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:66341:249"/>
their Old Age. If it had really been ſo, I could have pitied and forgiven him many Extravagancies, which are venial Faults in a Poet, but unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable in a Profeſſor of Divinity.</p>
                  <p>Here I once thought to diſmiſs him, but upon ſecond Thoughts, I reſolved to attend him a little fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and conſider the Reflections wherewith he concludeth his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face: I ſhall ſay nothing in defence of Proteſtant Tranſlators three Reflections, which ſtand firm after all his weak aſſaults upon them.</p>
                  <p>His firſt Reflection is, That ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing, though falſly, that <hi>Ratram</hi> intended to diſpute againſt the <hi>Real Preſence,</hi> yet ſince he treats his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries as <hi>Catholicks,</hi> and calleth them the <hi>Faithful;</hi> the Queſtion in diſpute muſt neceſſarily have been ſome opinion of leſs moment than the <hi>Real Preſence;</hi> the belief thereof, or of the contrary, could never have been held indifferent by the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
                  <p>Not to ſpend time in expoſing his abſurd pretence to ſuppoſe a thing, when he immediately aſſumes, and concludeth the contrary, I deny this conſequence, <hi>viz. Ratram</hi> doth not
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:66341:249"/>
call his Adverſaries Hereticks, but treats them as Brethren, therefore he did not write againſt the Real Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. All that can be concluded thence, is, that the Adverſaries of that Doctrin were then as they ſtill are, Perſons of a more charitable and meek Spirit, than thoſe who maintain and propagate it. There is a great deal of difference between Hereſie, and ſome groſs Errors, whoſe Patrons do not deſert the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church; and therefore it doth not follow, that becauſe <hi>Ratram</hi> treats theſe <hi>Erring Brethren</hi> as Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, and includes them with their Adverſaries in the common Notion of <hi>Faithful,</hi> he muſt needs eſteem the Queſtion in diſpute of ſo little mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that it was indifferent which way it was held. It's plain, he<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Num. 11.</note> chargeth them with Conſequences very abſurd,<note n="(b)" place="bottom">Num. 15.</note> with contradicting themſelves, with ſubverting what they pretended to believe;<note n="(c)" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Num. 32.</hi> Sanctorum Scriptis Patrum contraire comprobantur.</note> and
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:66341:250"/>
with contradicting the Authority of the Fathers, which are no very ſlight Accuſations, and ſhew plainly, that he did not eſteem it a matter of no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whether his own or his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries Opinion were embraced.</p>
                  <p>His ſecond Reflection is, That <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tram</hi> could not poſſibly write againſt <hi>Paſchaſe,</hi> becauſe he takes no notice of the Miracle of Chriſt's Apparition in the form of Fleſh, alledged by <hi>Paſchaſe</hi> in the fourteenth Chapter of his Book.</p>
                  <p>To which I Anſwer, 1. That there is no neceſſity that he ſhould take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of this Miracle any more than he doth of his other Arguments, ſince, as it hath been before obſerved, that it is the Notion and not the Book of <hi>Paſchaſe,</hi> againſt which he diſputeth. He acts the part of an Opponent throughout, and never anſwers one Argument, ſave that he once, <hi>N.</hi> 56. obviates an Objection from St. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. That admitting us to pretend, that <hi>Ratram</hi> encountered the Book of <hi>Paſchaſe,</hi> we may as fairly from our Author's Silence infer, that there were no ſuch Miracles alledged in it, but that thoſe Fables were ſince foiſted in.

M. <hi>Boileau</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Blondel</hi> rejects the whole Chapter as ſpurious; I have not his Book at command to ſee his Reaſons, but I cannot believe he did it without all Authority, as is pretended. M. <hi>Boileau</hi>

the Falſhood and Impudence of theſe fained Apparitions, or rather of their Fabulous Author,<note n="(h)" place="bottom">

If they did not, the whole was a meer Illuſion and Fancy. And on the other hand if they did, Then Chriſt according to the deſcription of the firſt, and third Miracle is <hi>ſtill an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant,</hi> both the <hi>Jew</hi> and the <hi>Saxon</hi> Prieſt are ſaid to have ſeen a little Child. Again, Chriſt muſt be divided into ſeveral parts, as the <hi>Jew</hi> ſaw his Body broken in Pieces in St. <hi>Baſil</hi>'s Hands. Again, every Communicant doth not Receive Chriſt Intire, but only ſome part of him, for the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Matron ſaw the Piece which ſhe was to receive, turned<note n="(i)" place="bottom">him bam ƿear ð aeteoƿed seo snaed ðaes husles ðe heo ðicgan sceolde sƿyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce ðar laeg on ðam disce anes fingres liþ aeal geblodgod. <hi>Hom.

the little Finger all Bloody. Again, at this rate Chriſt muſt be actually ſlain, and the Sacrifice of the Altar be a Bloody Sacrifice, for the <hi>Jew</hi> is ſaid to ſee his Body divided in S. <hi>Baſils</hi> hands, and our <hi>Saxon</hi> Miracle Monger tells us that the two Monks, <hi>ſaw an Angel with a Sword at Conſecration di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the Childs Body,</hi> and <hi>pour his Blood into the Chalice,</hi> and if ſo what becomes of the Doctrin of Concomitancy? So that either theſe Miracles prove nothing at all, or elſe they prove what will as little conſiſt with the Romiſh Belief as with ours.</p>
                  <p>His Third Reflection is this, That if <hi>Ratram</hi> had been againſt the Real Preſen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e, he would not have failed to have Reproached the <hi>Greeks</hi> with the Belief of it, in his four Books Written againſt them,</p>
                  <p>But this is a very Trifling Remark, for this was a point upon which the <hi>Greek</hi> as well as the <hi>Latin</hi> Church was at that time divided, and as it had been unreaſonable to Reproach the whole Church with the Errors of one Party, ſo it had been Imprudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done to object to the <hi>Greek</hi> a Re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>proach which might have been retort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Latin Church.</p>

                     <pb n="50" facs="tcp:66341:254"/>This ſmall Tract for ſixſcore year, together is forbidden, Condemned for Heretical by the general Vote of moſt of their Great Divines, Popes, Cardinals and others; I may add the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> too, which had as great an Intereſt in that Index wherein <hi>Bertram</hi> ſtands Condemned, as it had in the Catechiſm. Now all on a ſudden he is acknowledged for a good Catholick. But tho he be ſo in <hi>France,</hi> I doubt in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> his Doctrin, were he alive to Anſwer for it, would bring him in danger of the Inquiſition. Nay tho this Tract be pronounced Orthodox at <hi>Paris</hi> by M. <hi>Boileau</hi> and his Brethren, yet at <hi>Lyons</hi> it is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected as Spurious, or at leaſt Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated with Heretical mixture, ſuch Bleſſed Agreement is there among their Doctors of this and the laſt Age, and of thoſe of <hi>France,</hi> with their Brethren in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Spain;</hi> nay in <hi>France</hi> it ſelf between M. <hi>de Marca</hi> A.

another Metropolitical Church, who ſaith it is Catholick, and written for the real Preſence.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps it may be ſaid, that this is matter of <hi>Fact</hi> to which the Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity doth not extend, but not of <hi>Faith;</hi> But by their leave, I look upon it a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Faith,</hi> and what neerly concerns mens Conſciences, eſpecially in an Age of Converſions. For the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not whether the Book be Genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in or Spurious, but whether the Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin which it contains be <hi>Orthodox</hi> or <hi>Heretical.</hi> Suppoſe a wavering Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick ſhould come to M. <hi>Boileau,</hi> and propoſe his doubts concerning the <hi>Trent</hi> Doctrin having been ſhocked in his belief thereof, by that paſſage of S. <hi>Auſtine,</hi> which made <hi>Frudegard</hi> doubt the Truth of <hi>Paſchaſe</hi> his Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin, and make Confeſſion of his <hi>Faith</hi> in the words of <hi>Bertram,</hi> 
                     <q>Set your Heart at reſt, your Belief is very ſound, you are a good Catholick, would M. <hi>Boileau</hi> ſay.</q> But then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this is but one Doctors Opinion, ſhould he Conſult M. <hi>Paris</hi> who ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>De Marca</hi>'s conjecture, he would tell him this is down right <hi>Hereſie,</hi> condemned in ſeveral Councils, and every body knoweth the Importance
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:66341:255"/>
of that Sin, and that ſuch a Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt needs diſturb the Conſcience, which was ſet at eaſe by M. <hi>Boileau</hi>'s more favourable Sentence. Such cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain direction have men in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Communion for their Faith and Conſciences over what we have! I am of opinion, few of their doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Catholicks, or New Converts are able to declare their <hi>Faith</hi> touching the Sacrament ſo Intilligibly and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly, as <hi>Ratram</hi> hath delivered his Judgment in this Book, and I fear few of their Spiritual Guides underſtand what is the Doctrin of their Church better than thoſe Doctors who have Condemned <hi>Ratram</hi> for an Heretick.</p>
                  <p>And withal, Where is the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of private Spirits, and their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to Church Authority, when three or four <hi>Sorbon</hi> Doctors confront three Popes, five Cardinals, beſides Archbiſhops, and Biſhops, with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Doctors, almoſt numberleſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Methinks it looks like an Argument that private Spirits in that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, are as Wanton and Ungo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernable, as among the Proteſtants. And methinks, Mr. <hi>Sclater</hi> ſeems to reſolve his own Converſion into the Dictates of the private Spirit, and
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:66341:255"/>
that whatever opinion he might have of thoſe Divines, who carried Church Authority higheſt, yet he had little Reverence for it himſelf, otherwiſe he would have liſtened to the Liturgy, Articles, and Homilies, which are the publick Doctrin of our Church, rather than the moderate Declarations of Biſhop <hi>Forbes,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Andrews,</hi> and Biſhop <hi>Taylor,</hi> that is one ſingle Biſhop in each of thoſe three Kingdoms, who notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing believed Tranſubſtantiation no more than we now do.</p>
                  <p>And though he reproach our pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Spirits with ſenſing the five lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Words of our Saviour, any Man that ever looked into Controverſie, can tell him, that the private Spirits of his Church have with a much more extravagant Wantonneſs, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thoſe Words contradicting one another almoſt in the ſenſe of every Word; and whilſt they condemn us for admitting one Figure, Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by Scripture Examples, and the Authority of the Fathers, in which we all agree, they are forced without any ſuch Authority to admit ſeveral, Quarrelling with one another about the ſenſe of almoſt every Word.
